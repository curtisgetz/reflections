When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
    When you want to share your work to get input from others. Or to collaborate. Or if you will want 
    to access the project from differnet computers. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
		So you don't have incomplete parts of your project being shared with the public
		You may not want a part of your project released to the public until you decide 
		you're ready 
		
		
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks are when you want your own version of someone else's project. It copies their repository to 
	your GitHub and allows you to work on it. It does not give you permissions to edit the original. 
	clone copies a remote respository to your local machine (or copies local to local)
	branches are used when you want to take your project in another direction while leaving the main
	project unaffected. Use this to try our new features
