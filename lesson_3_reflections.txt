When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
    When you want to share your work to get input from others. Or to colaborate. Or if you will want 
    to access the project from differnet computers. 

	Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
	stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
		So you don't have incomplete parts of your project being shared with the public
		You may not want a part of your project released to the public until you decide 
		you're ready
