What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	.git directory is created. If you did not do this then it would just be a normal 
	directory without any git information
	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is not saved unless you commit it. This allows you to plan your commit and make
	changed until you're satisfied without affecting anything else
